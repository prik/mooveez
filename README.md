# Mooveez

An IMDB-like app I made to learn front-end stuff. Uses Alan to control the app via voice commands.

This app is now finished and enjoyable at https://mooveez.netlify.app/.

Click the microphone icon on the bottom right corner and ask the app to show you around, and you will learn how to navigate the website by voice.
